## Recruitment Marketing Tools

Recruitment marketing is the process of promoting your employer brand with the use of marketing methodologies to attract, engage and nurture relationships with qualified talent. Companies like BuiltIn for example will write articles about your company -- e.g., "Top 5 Crypto Companies in Austin, Texas" -- and feature your jobs in the sidebar of the article in attempt to drive local or other targeted talent to you.

## Applicant Tracking Systems \(ATS\) / HR Platforms

ATS tools generally facilitate job posting, career page building/management, candidate sourcing, and applicant tracking. Some include advanced features such as employee referral management, interviewing, talent CRM, and onboarding support. 

Some tools cover broader HR activities including payroll, benefits, absence management \(PTO\), expenses, org charts, scheduling, compliance, health and safety, timesheets and time-clocking, and employee satisfaction. Tools that cover these broader activities are tagged with the sub-category "HR" below. 

You can find more details on pricing and feature comparisons [here](https://www.g2.com/categories/applicant-tracking-systems-ats) or click the Capterra or g2 links in the notes below.

## Recruiting Agencies

There are few crypto-specific recruiting agencies. To our knowledge, few member companies have used the services below so their ROI is unclear. 

In general, recruiting agencies are expensive, charging somewhere around 20% or more of a candidate's first year of salary as a recruiting fee \(this is typically negotiable, particularly for startups\). 

Alternatively, once a startup reaches a certain size or demand for growth, they may hire a part- or full-time in-house recruiter. Given the upfront cost of recruiting agencies, this may be economically favorable.

## Community Building / Recruitment Marketing

Building a community or participating in one can help to generate a recurring funnel of candidates. This takes significant time and other resources but the payoff can be large \(though not guaranteed\). 

Participation can include simply participating, sponsoring or ultimately organizing events in local or online communities. Events include hackathons, blockchain/crypto clubs, venture/startup meetups, career fairs, or summits/conferences. Other ideas for building communities may include creating a high quality newsletter or forum. 

Below is a list of well-known events to consider.

## Proactive Outreach

Some member companies have found success hiring engineers by posting jobs on their social channels including LinkedIn and Twitter or by searching [GitHub](https://github.com/) and looking at a specific project's GitHub page, searching hackathon submissions/winners, blog posts, etc. Some members noted writing scripts to pull emails from GitHub. 

Other options for pro-active outreach include searching through LinkedIn or other candidate marketplaces but doing this manually without tooling can be very time-consuming and unlikely to reap rewards.
