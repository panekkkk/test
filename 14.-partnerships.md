# 14. Partnerships

## Lambda School

[Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) is an online [data science](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science) and [full stack web ](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/full-stack-web-development)coding school. 

Alliance member companies looking for data scientists or full stack web devs can partner with Lambda School as a "hiring partner". There is no cost to become a hiring partner. Becoming a hiring partner includes filling out a self-serve profile that Lambda students can opt in to, allowing students to contact you. 

You may also participate in their fellows program or view recent grads [here](https://lambdaschool.com/profiles). Companies hiring for many roles can work with Lambda School to create a more customized program. 

{% hint style="info" %}
To sign up, please contact **Christy Lehman** at **christy.lehman@lambdaschool.com** and reference The DeFi Alliance and Jacob Franek as your contact. Please note that the Alliance does not yet have any experience with Lambda School so if you pursue this, your feedback is extremely important.

## Consensys Academy

Consensys Academy helps to educate developers and others in blockchain development and other areas, with particular focus on Ethereum and Solidity. They offer on-demand courses, a bootcamp, and also hold a graduation summit for each graduating bootcamp cohort which can serve as a funnel for hiring. 

Alliance members can therefore view the Academy as an educational and hiring partner. 

### Education

The Academy offers two different types of educational courses:

1. On-Demand Courses
2. Bootcamp

#### On-Demand Courses

You can find the Academy's course catalog [here](https://learn.consensys.net/catalog). The recommended course for Solidity development is the [Blockchain Developer Program](https://learn.consensys.net/catalog/info/id:141). This is an online course that can be started at any time. The cost is **$295**. Once completed, a developer may become certified by taking the [certification exam](https://learn.consensys.net/catalog/info/id:154) \(at an additional cost of **$275\)**. Certification is not required. 

#### Bootcamp

The Academy also offers a developer [bootcamp](https://courses.consensys.net/courses/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-registration-2020). Bootcamp start dates are however not pre-determined and are instead set once sufficient demand is met \(at least 50 interested developers\). It typically takes around 3 months from the time demand is met to when the bootcamp can begin. 

The bootcamp runs for **11 weeks** and the cost is **$985**. However, there is also a "**free**" option but it requires students to participate in a "**work study**" requiring students to complete some part-time work for the Academy in lieu of payment. This work may include simple tasks like writing FAQs or helping with some course content. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The Alliance is currently working to establish discounts for both the on-demand course and the bootcamp so please stay tuned for details and contact information. 
{% endhint %}

### Hiring 

For each bootcamp graduating cohort, the Academy hosts a two-week "Graduation Activities" event. This event brings together current graduates and alumni with mentors, hiring partners, and others. 

As a partner, the Alliance and its members can participate in the following ways:

* Link to job posts or the Alliance job board
* Sign up as a mentor 
* Set up meet-and-greets to introduce your company and open positions

Because graduates are from all over the world, meet-and-greets are hosted as Zoom meetings in cohorts of 25-30 students at a time. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The Alliance is working with the Academy to participate in the upcoming graduation cohort in **December**. Please stay tuned for details and contact information.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Alliance is working with Gitcoin to determine broader partnership and sponsorship opportunities. This includes the option for the Alliance or member companies to host an entire hackathon, sponsor or otherwise participate in the [December 2nd hackathon](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17XkBJKm8SVslYFBfmGKpiVBcQw04MDWglvQuRicynTI/edit#slide=id.g75d1fd9870_0_0), or sponsor or participate in [KERNEL Block 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17440RigdmCb6DbHpwjjBwODlGFhsVbbwLjwX7E5em68/edit#slide=id.ga76a092646_2_0) or the [KERNEL Security Track](https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-kernel-security-track/). If member companies are interested in participating on their own, do not hesitate to pursue any of these items since a broader Alliance partnership is not guaranteed. Please stay tuned for details and contact information.
