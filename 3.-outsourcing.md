# 3. Outsourcing

Outsourcing can range from outsourcing small bounties \(i.e., tasks\) to freelance developers to hiring entire development teams on a part-time or full-time basis. There are many outsourcing companies across the landscape of backend, frontend or full stack development so only recommended companies are listed below \(with particular focus on crypto\).
