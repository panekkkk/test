# Introduction

**Objective**: This wiki is intended to provide Alliance members with a **well-curated** list of resources to help with the recruitment process from start to finish. 

Generally speaking, the recruitment process is long and complex. It is likely that your network will drive the majority of your first few hires. However, as you grow your goal should be to build a repeatable and scalable process. You should consider [treating your hiring process like a product](https://firstround.com/review/develop-your-hiring-system-like-a-product-to-eliminate-bias-and-boost-retention/) and work to build an MVP and improve it over time.

In the subsequent pages, you will encounter many different recruiting tools and resources that broadly cover the entire recruitment process including broader HR activities \(such as payroll or benefits\). Some tools cover everything whereas others cover only components. Generally speaking, tools that do more will be more expensive and may not be as effective as tools that are focused on only one thing.

Not all tools are necessary at an early stage so your challenge will be determining how to build your process and which tools to work with as you grow. We hope to provide some advice on this shortly.

Note that this wiki is a **work-in-progress** and thus will improve over time so please keep an eye out for updates. Your **feedback** is critical in ensuring that the tools, tips and other resources are well-vetted and of the highest quality. We may therefore provide members with edit or comment access. In the meantime, please provide feedback via the \#recruiting channel in the Alliance Slack or email **jacob.franek@gmail.com**.
